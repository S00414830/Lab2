## Executive Summary 
The purpose of Lab 2 was to learn about hardware is what you can touch. The major components are hardware, are desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile phones, tablet computers, e-readers, storage devices-flash drive, input devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners and output devices like printers and speakers. This summary includes hardware.

### Hard Drives and Memory 
Two differences between RAM and a hard disk drive?.RAM can transfer data much faster than a hard disk drive and Can store data as long as it is receiving power (volatile),once power is off all data lost.

#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Maximum latency = 60/rpm Average latency = 0.5*Latency Time	It takes about 1 sec to transfer 30-60MB of data.What is the bus of a computer? The bus is on the motherboard. The bus is telling one the electrical connections between different computer components. The bus is the speed that data is transferred.

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
