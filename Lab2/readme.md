## Executive Summary 
The purpose of Lab 2 was to learn about hardware is what you can touch. The major components are hardware, are desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile phones, tablet computers, e-readers, storage devices-flash drive, input devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners and output devices like printers and speakers. This summary includes hardware. 

## Hardware
The major components are hardware, are desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile phones, tablet computers, e-readers, storage devices-flash drive, input devices like keyboards, mice, and scanners and output devices like printers and speakers.

### Hard Drives and Memory 
Two differences between RAM and a hard disk drive?.RAM can transfer data much faster than a hard disk drive and Can store data as long as it is receiving power (volatile),once power is off all data lost.

#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Maximum latency = 60/rpm Average latency = 0.5*Latency Time	It takes about 1 sec to transfer 30-60MB of data.What is the bus of a computer? The bus is on the motherboard. The bus is telling one the electrical connections between different computer components. The bus is the speed that data is transferred.

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
What are the advantages of solid-state drives over hard disk? SSD stores data and much more reliable. Also is lighter, more durable, and more efficient the above is the advantages of SSD over a hard disk.

#### Random Access Memory
 Random Access Memory stands for RAM
 
### ALU and the Control Unit
The principal component of the CPU is the Arithmetic Logic Unit and Control Unit. The difference between ALU and CPU is that ALU is an electronic circuit, which is a subsystem of CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations while a CPU is an electronic circuit that handles instructions to operate the computer The control unit controls and monitors communications between the hardware attached to the computer. It controls the input and output of data, checks that signals have been delivered successfully, and makes sure that data goes to the correct place at the correct time.

### CPU, Input & Output
The CPU can also be thought as the --------of the computer? Brains.CPU process data, Input devices- like keyboards, mice, and scanners. Output device devices like printers and speakers.

### Logic Gates 
A logic gate is a device performing a Boolean logic operation on one or more binary inputs and then outputs a single binary output. Computers perform more than simple Boolean logic operations on input data, and they typically output more than a single binary digit

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
First Edition is a comprehensive report that combines a conceptual framework addressing universal human values, data agency, and technical dependability with a set of principles to guide A/IS creators and users through a comprehensive set of recommendations.

## Data Representation
The data representation can be decimal, binary, hexadecimal and hexadecimal color.

### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
2003 = 2 * 103 + 0 * 102 + 0 * 101 + 3 * 100 position 3 2 1 0 As you can see, each weight is the power of 10 to the number position starting at 0. The * represents multiplication and any number raised to the power of zero = 1; Binary and Hexadecimal Number Systems Binary and Hexadecimal number systems are examples of positional number systems with different bases. Binary number systems use a base of two while hexadecimal uses a base of 16.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Hexadecimal numbers are used on web pages to set colors. ... A color can be made by mixing Red, Green and Blue, so it is called the "RGB Color System". An example of hexidecimal color is ab00ff that represents RGB. Red= 67.1%, Green= 0% and Blue = 100%. The color here is violet or pure violet. This color may also be represented by this decimal value
11206911. The problem that may occur with hexadecimal color representation is individuals with color vision deficiency may not see the color. The benefit of using the hexadecimal color website it shows the color in may forms such as tone, conversions, schemes, alternatives, shades, tints and color blindness simulator. However, with the hexadecimal color representation all may understand a colors make up of red, green and blue in a consistent manner. This color representations is valuable to web designers.
